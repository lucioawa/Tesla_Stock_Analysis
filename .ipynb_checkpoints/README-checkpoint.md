#### Source of data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/tesla-stock-data-updated-till-28jun2021)

### **Overview**

Welcome to the "Tesla Stock Analysis and Machine Learning Predictions" project. This project is a comprehensive exploration of Tesla's historical stock data, involving data analysis, feature engineering, machine learning model development, and backtesting. The goal is to gain insights from the data, create a robust machine learning model for predicting Tesla's stock prices, and continuously improve its performance.

### **Project Structure**

The project is organized into several key sections:

#### **I. Data Analysis**

In this section, we perform in-depth analysis on Tesla's stock data from June 29, 2010, to March 24, 2022. The analysis includes:

* **Basic Summary Statistics:** An overview of key statistics.
* **Yearly Average Closing Prices:** Annual trends in closing prices.
* **Highest Volume Analysis:** Identification of the highest volume days and their impact.
* **Moving Averages:** Calculating 10-day moving averages.
* **Significant Price Changes:** Detecting days with significant price changes.
* **Yearly Price Range:** Determining annual low and high price ranges.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Investigating correlations between volume and closing prices.
* **Insights:** Valuable insights gained from the data analysis.

#### **II. Machine Learning Model** 

This section focuses on building a machine learning model to predict Tesla's stock prices. The process includes:

A. Forming a Hypothesis

* The hypothesis revolves around predicting Tesla's stock price based on a specific stock strategy.

B. Finding the Data

* We utilize Tesla's stock data, which is available on Kaggle.

C. Reshaping the Data

* Setting the 'Date' column as the DataFrame index.
* Visualizing Tesla's stock market data.
* Creating target columns ('tomorrow' and 'target') for predictions.

D. Cleaning the Data

* Removing unnecessary columns.
* Handling missing values.
* Removing outdated data.

E. Building a Machine Learning Model and Splitting the Data

* Training an initial baseline Machine Learning model.
* Defining model parameters.
* Creating a Random Forest Classifier.
* Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
* Defining predictors.
* Fitting the model.

F. Finding an Error Metric

* Measuring model accuracy with a precision score.
* Plotting predictions.
* Drawing insights from predictions.

G. Backtesting the Model

* Creating prediction and rolling window backtest functions.
* Evaluating prediction errors.
* Analyzing the frequency of predictions.
* Evaluating precision scores and performance.

H. Feature Engineering

* Adding more predictors within specified windows (e.g., 2, 5, 60, 250, 1000 days).
* Handling NaN columns and addressing errors.

I. Hyperparameter Tuning

* Fine-tuning hyperparameters for the Random Forest Algorithm.
* Refining the predict function.
* Iterating on backtesting.

J. Comparison of Results

* Comparing results using different rolling window backtest configurations.

K. Conclusion

* Summarizing the findings and lessons learned from backtests.

L. Next Steps to Improve Machine Learning Model

* Listing key strategies and plans for further enhancing the machine learning model's accuracy and robustness.

#### **Requirements**

* This project uses Python, primarily leveraging libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
* Access to Tesla's historical stock data, available on Kaggle.
